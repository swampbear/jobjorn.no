# Retrospective look at 2025

2025 is coming to an end. This year has offered a lot of great experiences. From working on interesting topics in my studies
to qualifying to the Cup final i Norwegian Volleyball. Also got engaged, which is kind of cool.

## Completing a bachelors in Information Technology

For our thesis we got to implement a RAG application for Fjord1. By we I mean me Sondre Ness and Siri Nordtrand. Together we formed a well balanced team,
with technical skill, problem solving skills and a good portion of good humor. We go to see the application in action for several tests and got a lot of positive feedback.
However it was not quite ready for production, since the LLM sometimes could answer wrong quite confidently. In some scenarios this could have big consequences.

## Work at HVL Robotics

The summer of 2025 marked my third year at HVL Robotics. They have always given me a lot of freedom to work with exiting projects and to learn new technologies.
This year I started the work on the Rehab-Twin platform. It is a react.js based application that uses three.js to visualize human motion in the browser.
Currently I have made a prototype for functionality using static data. However this christmas I will spend some time getting the database structure and ORM up and running.
Especially looking forward to this, since I have been spending some time on my backend knowledge the last 6 months.

## Masters in ICT Engineering

The first semester of ICT engineering have been intense. The topics I have completed includes:

- Cyber physical systems and IoT
- Datascience and AI prototyping
- Mathematical modelling and simulation

It is great to get som insights in other industries than just IT, and software engineering.

## Free time programming

When starting my masters in ICT Engineering, I set a goal for myself to program frequently and with some direction. To get myself started I went for [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).
There I can go in and learn in a fun and engaging way. I can do a 100 task in a day, or 1 in two weeks, depending on how much the studies require.
Im glad I went for this, spending some time programming every day has heavily damped my imposter syndrome.

For my IDE choice, I have decided to go learning NEOVIM. YES I use NEOVIM BTW. Has it made me more productive? Probably, not. However there are some great positives.
I started to enjoy coding on a new level after I started using it. It forces me to be in the zone to be able to move around and use macros, which then helps me be more focused on my tasks.
VS CODE of course still offers a lot of good funcitonality, but configuring and selecting your own config, based on your needs gives a unique understanding Im happy I stumbled upon.

## Volleyball

Before this season I could never have imagined us playing as well as we do. It has been great. We are a large core of the team now that have been working for many years
to get better, and help each other meet our goals. This year it has payed off. Top of the league for christmas, and cup final ready. So happy to be part off
a great club in all sences with a lot of people making it possible for us to enjoy the sport we love.

## Personal life

Got engaged. Thats right, I use NEOVIM and Im engaged, feels pretty great. It happend during out cozy car trip holiday to Kragrø and Oslo. At Jomfru land(Virin Land direclty translated..)
We went to the spa, ate good food and concluded the trip in Tusenfryd and Bjørneparken. A fantastic way to round of the summer holiday, really looking forward to the
